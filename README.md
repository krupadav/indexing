# indexing
Indexing in Python is a way to refer the individual items within an iterable by its position. In other words, you can directly access your elements of choice within an iterable and do various operations depending on our need. Indexing start from 0 and goes to (n-1),this is called positive indexing and it always start from left whereas negative indexing start from right and negative indexing starts from -1 and goes to -n. 
Indexing is not supported in all the data types of python. The data types in which indexing is supported are those whose background structure is array. 
Where indexing is supported there we can apply slicing as well
Slicing is a way we can split or divide or reverse the elements.If we do not mention slicing by default starts with 0th position and ends at the last position.
Lets see some example for better understanding
