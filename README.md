# indexing
Indexing in Python is a way to refer the individual items within an iterable by its position. In other words, you can directly access your elements of choice within an iterable and do various operations depending on our need. Indexing start from 0 and goes to (n-1),this is called positive indexing and it always start from left whereas negative indexing start from right and negative indexing starts from -1 and goes to -n. it is always represented i square brackets that is []. And a particular range is seperated with the help of colon(:). If we want to reverse the sequence we need to write -1 after ::
Indexing is not supported in all the data types of python. The data types in which indexing is supported are those whose background structure is array. 
Where indexing is supported there we can apply slicing as well
Slicing is a way we can split or divide or reverse the elements.If we do not mention slicing by default starts with 0th position and ends at the last position. Here starting point is included but ending point (that is the specified end point in the slicing) is not included. E.g:- [1:3] here element at position 1 and 2 will be displayed but at the 3rd position will not
Lets see some example for better understanding
